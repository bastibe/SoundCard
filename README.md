# SoundCard

SoundCard is a library for playing and recording audio without resorting to a CPython extension. Instead, it is implemented using the wonderful [CFFI](http://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the native audio libraries of Linux, Windows and macOS.

SoundCard is cross-platform, and supports Linux/pulseaudio, Mac/coreaudio, and Windows/WASAPI. While the interface is identical across platforms, naming schemes and block sizes can vary between devices and platforms.

SoundCard is still very early in its development. All major building blocks are in place, but I fully expect there to be bugs and possibly crashes. If you find a bug, please open an Issue, and I will try to fix it. Or open a Pull Request, and I will try to include your fix into SoundCard.

However, please be aware that this is a hobby project of mine that I am developing for free, and in my spare time. While I try to be as accomodating as possible, I can not guarantee a timely response to issues. Publishing Open Source Software on Github does not imply an obligation to *fix your problem right now*. Please be civil.

## Tutorial

Here is how you get to your Speakers and Microphones:

```python
import soundcard as sc

speakers = sc.all_speakers()
default_speaker = sc.default_speaker()
mics = sc.all_microphones()
default_mic = sc.default_microphone()
# search by substring:
one_speaker = sc.get_speaker('Scarlett')
one_mic = sc.get_microphone('Scarlett')
# fuzzy-search:
one_speker = sc.get_speaker('FS2i2')
one_mic = sc.get_microphone('FS2i2')
```

All of these functions return `Speaker` and `Microphone` objects, which can be used for playback and recording. All data passed in and out of these objects are *frames Ã— channels* Numpy arrays.

```python
import numpy

print(default_speaker)
>>> <Speaker alsa_output.usb-Focuswrite_Scarlett_2i2_USB-00-USB.analog-stereo (2 channels)>
print(default_mic)
>>> <Microphone alsa_input.usb-Focuswrite_Scarlett_2i2_USB-00-USB.analog-stereo (2 channels)>

# record and play back one second of audio:
data = default_mic.record(samplerate=44100, numframes=44100)
default_speaker.play(data/numpy.max(data), samplerate=44100)

# alternatively, get a `recorder` and `player` object and play or record continuously:
with default_mic.recorder(samplerate=44100) as mic, default_speaker.player(samplerate=44100) as sp:
    for _ in range(100):
        data = mic.record(num_frames=1024)
        sp.play(data)
```

## Known Issues:

* macOS/coreaudio currently does not record the first block correctly. The reason for this is still unknown.
* Linux/pulseaudio sometimes shows many spurious microphones, some of which seem to be USB sound cards that have been disconnected. Obviously, these microphones won't work. The default microphone should work, though.
* Linux/pulseaudio does not report nice device names yet. This will be improved in the future.
* All sound cards use all channels at all times. Proper channel mapping will be implemented in the future.
* Error messages often report some internal CFFI/backend errors. This will be improved in the future.
* Documentation is not great yet. This will be improved in the future.
